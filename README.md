# Upstox Assignment

This assignment include two pages
  1) Open-high-low-close(OHLC) chart with date
  2) Live OHLC updating chart
  
Both charts are responsive and has a zoom option you can zoom the chart by scrolling your mouse, and by selecting a date range.

## I used below technologies to complete this assignment
  1) HTML5
  2) CSS3
  3) JavaScript
  4) React.js and Redux
  
For OHLC chart i used third party JavaScript (HTML5) tool "fusioncharts.com". <br />
I used redux (Redux Thunk middleware) for fatching api's data and store the data in redux-store.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
